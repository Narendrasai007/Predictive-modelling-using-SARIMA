# Predictive-modelling-using-SARIMA

This is a project I have accomplished during my masters at the university of Kent, The project was about to improve the accuracy of future sales forecasts by using ANN and machine learning models. 

This is the main readme.me file will act as an information file:

This study collected monthly sales data CX's compact crane for past 12 years from 2005 January to September 2017 with no missing values. Further the data was converted to date time series before data analysis. The data Analysis was computed using phyton Google collab. 

The study used algorithms such as Decomposition model, Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin, and Seasonal Autoregressive integrated moving average model.
